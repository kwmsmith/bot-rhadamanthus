Rhadamanthus: An Arimaa Bot
==============================================================================

Arimaa_ is a two player, turn-based game with simple rules and deep strategy.
It is significantly `more complex than chess`_, yet is easy for people to
learn and play (and very hard for computers).  You can play people or bots
(like this one) online_.

About the name "Rhadamanthus"
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Wikipedia tells us that Rhadamanthus was a "wise king, the son of Zeus and
Europa...According to one account, Rhadamanthus ruled Crete before Minos, and
gave the island an excellent code of laws, which the Spartans were believed to
have copied."

Rhadamanthus is also the sophotech ("smart machine") of the Silver-Gray
Manorial Schola in John C. Wright's far-future space opera, the Golden Age
Trilogy.  He (Rhadamanthus) takes the physical form of a flying penguin, and
is one of the most interesting characters in the series.  Since he is a wholly
man-made intelligence, I thought naming an Arimaa bot after him was
appropriate.
